# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
The Speech Emotion Recognition project used the TESS dataset to classify emotions like happiness, anger, and sadness from audio. MFCCs were extracted, and an LSTM model was trained and optimized, achieving high accuracy. This showcased skills in deep learning, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
